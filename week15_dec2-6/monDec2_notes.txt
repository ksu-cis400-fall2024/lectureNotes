////////////////////////////

Tutorial: POST requests and JSON (due today)
    - GET requests: to retrieve data
    - POST requests: to submit data
    - POST requests have more security, can send more data
    - can use JSON to simulate an external database
    - deserialize from JSON into objects when your application starts
    - serialize objects to JSON when a change is made
    - (in practice, you would use an external database for a web application)


Milestone 12 (due Friday, December 6)
    - Add a reviews link to your website
    - Should load previous reviews (sorted with newest on top)
    - User can add new reviews
    - All reviews are stored in JSON
    - To "submit": demo in class or office hours
        - show adding a couple of reviews (with newest on top)
        - show closing web app, launching again - reviews should still be there,
            and should be able to add new reviews

--> see milestone 12 demo



/////////////////////////////////

For reviews:
- Create a data class for each review (string Text, DateTime PlacedAt)
- Create static ReviewDatabase class to load/add reviews
- Deserialize JSON to a List of those reviews
- When displaying reviews, will want to use OrderByDescending on the PlacedAt
    property

--> you can have a Reviews property in your PageModel that gets the result
    of a LINQ query that orders the ReviewDatabase reviews by PlacedAt
