Need order summary to update subtotal/tax/total as you add/remove items

Answer: Order implements INotifyPropertyChanged


public event PropertyChangedEventHandler? PropertyChanged;


Need to invoke PropertyChanged whenever something happens that changes
    the value of a property


PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(nameof(PropertyName)));


--> user controls are subscribed to the PropertyChanged event for their DataContext
    --> if the control uses data binding with the affected property, it
        will automatically rerender itself



When do we need to invoke PropertyChanged? For what properties?

    Add: Total, Subtotal, Tax
    Remove: Total, Subtotal, Tax
    Clear: Total, Subtotal, Tax


Also: TaxRate (affects: Tax, Total, TaxRate)



////////////////////////

Clarification: cancel order button
    call Clear on the order
    order number will not change
