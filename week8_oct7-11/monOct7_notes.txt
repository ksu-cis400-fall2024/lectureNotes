Data binding part 1: due tonight
    (NOTE: there is a mistake when handling remove in the tutorial
    - read the Canvas assignment for the correction)

Data binding part 2: due Tuesday

Milestone 6: due Thursday
    (let me know by Thursday if you need an extra day, and I'll move your
    deadline to Friday)

///////////////////////////////////

See MS 6 demo.


Milestone 6 summary:

- Use Order as DataContext (requires some changes to Order)
- Display name and price of each menu item in the order summary
- Subtotal/tax/total are automatically updated as items are added
- Cancel order is implemented
- Remove item is implemented

//////////////////////////////////

Data binding.

Idea: front end display is bound to back end data. Changing one changes both.



- Controls have a DataContext
- an attribute in a control can be bound to a property in the control's DataContext


In a control, can do something like:
    Text = "{Binding PropertyName}"

    or:
        Text = "{Binding Path=PropertyName}"


    or (if DataContext is an IEnumerable):
        ItemsSource="{Binding}"


--> control will see if its DataContext has property called PropertyName
    --> if it does, it displays PropertyName
    --> if it doesn't, it displays nothing (no errors)



Remember that different controls *can* have different DataContexts.

If they don't define their own, they "inherit" the DataContext of the
    control they were added to


//////////////////////////////////

Number property.

- Want first order to be 1

- Next order to be 2

- Etc.



Solution:
    private static uint _nextOrderNum = 1;

    private uint _number = _nextOrderNum++; //when does ++ happen?


    --> what to do in Number property?



//////////////////////////////////

PlacedAt property.
    - Type is DateTime
    - get-only
    - initialize to *now* (DateTime.Now)


//////////////////////////////////

INotifyCollectionChanged interface
    public event NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler? CollectionChanged;


This is an *event handler*

We can invoke CollectionChanged when the contents of a collection change 
    - when a collection is bound to a ListView, WPF automatically listens
        for CollectionChanged events
    - it attaches its own handler to CollectionChanged, which contains code 
        to redraw the GUI


CollectionChanged?.Invoke(...)

    - see Data Binding Tutorial 1
    - need to invoke CollectionChanged in Order's Add, Remove, Clear


////////////////////////////

What to do in SubHero?

In Order:
    - Create the Number and PlacedAt properties in Order
    - Implement INotifyCollectionChanged
    - Invoke CollectionChanged in in Add/Clear/Remove


In MainWindow:
    - Make the DataContext a new Order instead



In Order summary XAML:
    - Have order number TextBlock bound to Number property:
        ...Text="{Binding Number, StringFormat='Order number: {0}'}"

    - have date TextBlock bound to PlacedAt property (similar)

    - have subtotal/tax/total TextBlocks bound to those Order properties, like:
        ...Text="{Binding Subtotal, StringFormat='Subtotal: {0:C}'}"



- In menu selection code-behind:
    - Treat the DataContext as an Order



--> Once you do this, you should have the same behavior as MS5
    (but with the order number, date, and subtotal/tax/total coming from Order)

    Note: subtotal/tax/total will display $0.00 even as you add menu items 
    UNTIL Order also implements INotifyPropertyChanged

///////////////////////////

Implementing Cancel Order button.

- Add click event handler
- Get the DataContext as an Order, and call Clear


///////////////////////////

Displaying name/price/remove capability of each item in Order Summary:

<ListView HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch" ItemsSource="{Binding}">
    <ListView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            
            Now use a layout that includes:

                TextBlock for item's name (bind to Name property)
                TextBlock for item's price (bind to Price property)
                Preparation information for item (use a ListView)
                Button for removing the item (include a Click event)

        </DataTemplate>
    </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>


This layout will be applied to EACH item in the Order. The DataContext of 
the ListView.ItemTemplate is automatically an IMenuItem. Similarly, the
DataContext of the remove button is automatically an IMenuItem.

//////////////////////////

Write the remove click event handler in order summary code-behind:

private void RemoveItemClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)


What is DataContext?

What is sender?

What is sender's DataContext?

How to remove?

On Wednesday: we'll talk about implementing INotifyPropertyChanged
