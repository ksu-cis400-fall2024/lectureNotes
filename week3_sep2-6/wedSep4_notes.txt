Methods tutorial due yesterday
Milestone 2 due Friday

////////////////////////

What goes in different sections of memory:

- static: anything static, program itself, literals


- stack: anything scoped (method call, inside a loop,
    inside a conditional)


- heap: dynamic memory (anytime I use "new" - object or array)



Is static memory limited in size? Does the size change? When?
    static memory size does not change

Is stack limited in size? Does the size change? When?
    grows when I enter a new scope, like a method call
    shrinks when I leave a scope
    limited in size, but doesn't usually come up

Is heap limited in size? Does the size change? When?
    there are limits, don't usually hit
    grows when I say "new"
    shrinks when a space not referenced by stack or heap


Memory leaks?

////////////////////////

enums.

public enum SomeName 
{
    Value1, Value2, ...
}



--> are really ints (0, 1, 2, ...). 
    Can be cast to ints in this way.


--> can be in a standalone file or nested in a class


///////////////////

public enum Candy
{
    Reeses,
    KitKat,
    Snickers,
    Butterfinger  
}

--> declare an enum variable, set to KitKat

Candy c = Candy.KitKat;


--> print it (use an interpolated string)

//My favorite candy is KitKat

Console.WriteLine($"My favorite candy is {c}");


--> what if we wanted it to be "Kit Kat"?

have to use a conditional


--> how to loop through all enum values?

foreach (Candy c in Enum.GetValues<Candy>())
{

}


////////////////////////////////

- C# enums and namespace vs folder structure

--> creating an enum

--> creating a new folder

--> moving a file to a folder

--> creating an item in a folder


///////////////////////////////

Milestone 2

- add 5 new enums:
    - size of a menu item
    - type of bread
    - flavor of chips (a new menu item)
    - flavor of soda (a new menu item)
    - flavor of cookie (a new menu item)
    (why use enums instead of strings?)

- each sub/wrap/sandwich has a size and a bread choice property now***

- new classes: Chips, FountainDrink, Cookies

- each drink has a size now


--> be sure to enforce bounds on Cookies (2-6)
    --> error in writeup: Name should be "Cookies"


/////

Sub/wrap/sandwich size and bread:

--> default size is medium
--> default bread choice is given in writeup
--> size/bread restrictions: 
        hoagies can be any size
        wraps can only be medium
        wheat/sourdough can only be small/medium
--> DO NOT allow size/bread changes that would violate these
--> CAN first change bread or size to something else
    THEN edit

currently have a Mediterranean wrap
    default bread: wrap
    default size: medium

/////

Sub/wrap/sandwich calories.

--> "base" calories are for a medium with default bread
    --> adjust for non-default ingredients/bread
    --> THEN, scale your value for size
        small = 0.5, large = 1.5

--> "base" price is for a medium with default ingredients
    --> adjust for non-default ingredients
    --> scale based on size (small: $3 less, large: $2 more)

    e.g: small TurkeyCranberrySandwich on a hoagie 
        (by default, would be medium on wheat) 

        with provolone
        no red onion

    base calories = 605
        add 40 for a hoagie instead of bread 
            (bread = 250, wrap = 220, hoagie = 290)
        add 80 for provolone
        subtract 5 for onions
        = 720 (would be for a medium)

        scale for small = 360

    base price = $8.49
        add $1 for both cheeses
        subtract $3 for small
        = $6.49




--> be sure to document!

summary above class, property, method
methods should have params/return

Whether this ClubSub contains lettuce

--> reorganize code into folders. Be careful! 
    Might rename namespaces.
