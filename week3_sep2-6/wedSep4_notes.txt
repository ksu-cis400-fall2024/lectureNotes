Methods tutorial due yesterday
Milestone 2 due Friday

////////////////////////

What goes in different sections of memory:

- static: ?


- stack: ?


- heap: ?



Is static memory limited in size? Does the size change? When?


Is stack limited in size? Does the size change? When?


Is heap limited in size? Does the size change? When?


Memory leaks?

////////////////////////

enums.

public enum SomeName 
{
    Value1, Value2, ...
}



--> are really ints (0, 1, 2, ...). 
    Can be cast to ints in this way.


--> can be in a standalone file or nested in a class


///////////////////

public enum Candy
{
    Reeses,
    KitKat,
    Snickers,
    Butterfinger  
}

--> declare an enum variable, set to KitKat




--> print it (use an interpolated string)

//My favorite candy is KitKat




--> what if we wanted it to be "Kit Kat"?



--> how to loop through all enum values?


////////////////////////////////

- C# enums and namespace vs folder structure

--> creating an enum

--> creating a new folder

--> moving a file to a folder

--> creating an item in a folder


///////////////////////////////

Milestone 2

- add 5 new enums:
    - size of a menu item
    - type of bread
    - flavor of chips (a new menu item)
    - flavor of soda (a new menu item)
    - flavor of cookie (a new menu item)
    (why use enums instead of strings?)

- each sub/wrap/sandwich has a size and a bread choice property now***

- new classes: Chips, FountainDrink, Cookies

- each drink has a size now


--> be sure to enforce bounds on Cookies (2-6)
    --> error in writeup: Name should be "Cookies"


/////

Sub/wrap/sandwich size and bread:

--> default size is medium, default bread choice is given in writeup
--> size/bread restrictions: 
        hoagies can be any size
        wraps can only be medium
        wheat/sourdough can only be small/medium
--> DO NOT allow size/bread changes that would violate these restrictions
--> CAN first change bread or size to something else with fewer restrictions,
    THEN edit

/////

Sub/wrap/sandwich calories.

--> "base" calories for subs/wraps/sandwiches are for a medium with the
    default bread choice
    --> find the base calories first, adjusting for non-default ingredients/bread
    --> THEN, scale your value to get the calories for a different size
        small = 0.5, large = 1.5

--> "base" price is for a medium with default ingredients
    --> adjust for non-default ingredients
    --> scale based on size (small is $3 less, large is $2 more)

    e.g: small TurkeyCranberrySandwich on a hoagie with provolone
        but no red onion

    base calories = 605
        add 40 for a hoagie instead of bread (bread = 250, wrap = 220, hoagie = 290)
        add 80 for provolone
        subtract 5 for onions
        = ???

        scale for small = ???

    base price = $8.49
        add $1 for both cheeses
        subtract $3 for small
        = ???




--> be sure to document!

--> reorganize code into folders. Be careful! Might rename namespaces.
