////////////////

Begin Razor pages.
- inject C# code into HTML to create dynamic web pages
- will need to add new ASP.NET Core project
    (might need to choose "install more tools and features"
    when adding new project and then search for ASP bundle)

Tutorial 1 : Intro to Razor Pages (due today)
    - create a new ASP.NET Core project, review HTML and CSS,
        see PageModels

Tutorial 2: More with Razor Pages (due Tuesday)
    - read in JSON of movie info, display on a webpage
    - more with styling elements

Milestone 10: due Friday, November 15
- Create a website for SubHero
- About page, Privacy page
- Home page displays ALL menu options, sectioned by
    Entrees/Sides/Drinks/Combos
    --> also show available ingredients under Entrees



- Idea: create instance of all (as much as is reasonable...) so they're there
    and ready to search for next week

    Entrees: create instance of each type of sandwich/wrap/sub in 
        each possible bread/size combination. Don't need ingredient combinations.


    Sides: create all possible combinations EXCEPT side salad (just default for it)


    Drinks: create all possible combinations (EXCEPT Ice customization)


    Combos: create all possible all combinations with:
        - Each type of entree in its default configuration
        - Each type of side in its default configuration
        - Each type of drink in its default configuration

- Example: Fountain Drink. What combinations?
    flavor - 5
    size - 3

    5*3 = 15 combinations


- Example: Combo. What combinations?

    entree choices: 7
    side choices: 4
    drink choices: 3

    7*4*3 = 84 combos



Display for each item:
    - Name
    - Description (can skip for Combos, if you want)
    - Preparation Information
    - Price
    - Calories


user should be able to click to go to Entrees, Drinks, Sides, Combos


--> feel free to style however you want! Feel free to look online for CSS examples


--> if you don't like the look of all the menu combinations
- next week we'll be adding search/filters to our menu
- it will be easier if you have a menu with all those combinations
... BUT next week you are welcome to change how things are displayed on the page


////////////////////////

Menu class: FullMenu, Entrees, Sides, Drinks, Combos


(some List).AddRange(some IEnumerable);

Apple a = new() {Sliced = true};
_sides.Add(a);


When you add the ASP.NET web app project, be sure to right-click the 
    build your bowl solution and do Add->New project
